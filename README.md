# Tips for managing software development
Let us now have a look at some <a href="https://www.smarttask.io/blog/how-to-manage-software-teams">tips you must consider for managing software development</a>.
## Facilitate effective communication
Facilitating effective communication is a very crucial tip when it comes to managing a software
development team. For instance, if the project manager does not regularly check the remote
developers, it will make them feel disengaged and vulnerable to mistakes. So, communication
must be effective between the team members as well as the manager.
## Keep schedule consistent
Software development projects are highly dynamic, and therefore, resource requirements can
fluctuate frequently. It is, therefore, very crucial for the management to schedule the projects
consistently and determine the duration and completion framework. It has to be done
intelligently and ensure that it informs all about any unexpected delays and changes in plans.
## Avoid overly rigid processes
Orderly execution of activities is highly crucial when it comes to software projects. Dealing with
the complex Scenario in a project that is already very complex can be a highly difficult
management structure. Therefore, coordinators must ensure to <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/management_concepts/project_management_processes.htm">create simple new processes</a> which are time efficient, require less effort and save more money. Also, providing flexibility and
responsiveness is crucial.
## Give the right to decide
Team work is crucial in software development projects, and therefore, every team member must
be encouraged to make decisions. They must be given the power to make decisions so that you
get a lower burden of making decisions on their behalf. Also, it will free up your time, giving your
team more autonomy, and they will be able to work faster. For instance, you can give your team
members access to company cards along with them to make purchases whenever required.
## Set clear goals for the software team
Most teams work best when they have objectives to meet. When it comes to software
development teams, the targets are required to be public for the whole team so that they can
work collectively and achieve them in the given timeframe. It is also crucial to set useful
software development metrics for the team to better understand the task and meet the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-vs-clear-goals-md-zahid-hossain">goals</a>
that you have set.
## Create individual goals
Apart from the team goals, the requirement for <a href="https://www.liveplan.com/blog/which-are-better-individual-or-team-goals/">individual goals</a> is also significant in the software development teams. When you set a target, the individual members of the team have a target,
and they have a time frame to meet them. It is also very important to make sure that you
discuss these goals once a year by holding a one-on-one meeting so that you can increase the
number of team members from time to time.
## Take concerns seriously
In the software development teams, whenever there is a concern among the team members,
make sure to take it seriously. It is important to address their concerns on time so that they do
not feel retarded or ignored. By addressing their concerns, the managers can make them feel
important to the organization, and they will be more dedicated to meeting their targets.
## Be consistent on checkups
It is important for your team members to share every problem with you in the best manner
possible, and for that, you must try to perform work consistently. When you tell the team
members about something that you are going to do within the time frame, you make sure that it is completed within the said time. It will help you to build trust within the team, and you can lead your team in an efficient way.
## Keep open-door policy
When you keep a closed policy of having discussions with the team members, it makes it
difficult for the team members to convey their problems to you. With an <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-an-open-door-policy-could-be-the-key-to-staff-retention/437366">open door policy</a>, when a team member feels like they need to discuss something with you, you need to get time for
them. It will increase your respect as a manager among your team members, and it will remove blockers between you and your teams.
## Know your team members
Acknowledging the skill set of your team members is crucial for effective software development
team management. You can split the members according to their skills when required and get
the best results from their actions.
## Don’t micromanage
<a href="https://www.managementcenter.org/resources/staying-involved-without-micromanaging/">Micromanaging can decrease the productivity of the team</a>, and therefore, you must learn how to
get out of their way. Once you have made the important decisions, let the team make the rest of
the choices and let them do their work independently.
## Create examples yourself
If you want your team to work in a certain type of way, make sure to imply that to yourself first. It
is setting an example on your own first so that the team members can learn and follow the
same. By living as an example yourself, you can easily establish an expected culture.
## Give more context
Providing a context to the team members for doing something rather than just telling them to do
the work will help them work more effectively. The team members will know exactly what to do
and also believe that it is worth their time.
## Explain your decisions
Sometimes, you will have to make managerial decisions that others will not agree upon. It is not
always best to seek complete consensus, and therefore, you should be prepared to explain your
decisions. Explaining decisions to the software development teams can provide better clarity
between the team and the manager.
## Have a training budget
It is important to have a dedicated training budget in terms of money and time, and you must set
expectations of how and when the budget needs to be dedicated. Everyone learns differently,
and therefore, you must ensure that everyone learns with their preferred method of learning.
## Distill information as much as possible
The whole software development team works in a different way from the managerial part of the
company. Therefore, whenever there is information that you need to convey from the
managerial department to the software development, make sure to distill it as much as possible.
Try to provide the software development team with the information in the most technical way
possible for them to understand it easily.
## Final words
Management of software development teams is highly complex, and therefore, using
appropriate resources becomes important. Always make sure that you use reliable team
management software and follow the right strategies to handle the team working on software
development.
